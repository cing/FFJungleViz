# Force Field Jungle Visualization
There are now numerous force fields under constant revision for biomolecular simulation. Inspired by [this collection of papers on the Martini website](http://www.cgmartini.nl/index.php/blog/265-comparingforcefields), I developed this visualization to assist in disseminating the literature that contains side-by-side comparisons of 2 or more force fields.
